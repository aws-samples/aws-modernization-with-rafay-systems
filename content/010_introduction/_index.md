## Challenges Cloud Infrastructure and SRE Teams Are Facing Managing Cloud-Native Workloads

As you take on application modernization initiatives that leverage cloud native architectures, we will cover common challenges creating and operating consistent and standardized Kubernetes clusters, including:
 
- Maintaining security and regulatory compliance.
- Meeting service-level objectives with automation and fleet-wide visibility.

In order to accomplish this task, many cloud infrastructure and SRE teams are building their own platforms using disparate open source tools that meet the multiple business and technical requirements requiring domain expertise across multiple technologies and an increasing number of resources to develop and manage integration between tools and services taking focus away from higher value tasks and business objectives.
